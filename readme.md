# 🧩 Token-Lab

A simple web app that **tokenizes text into numbers** and also **decodes numbers back into text**.  
Built with **React + Vite**, this project is part of my learning journey in JavaScript, vector databases, and web development.

## 🧑‍💻 Why I Built This

*This project was created as part of my Cohort assignment with ChaiCode – GenAI with JS.
*It gave me hands-on experience in:
  * Understanding the basics of text tokenization (used in vector databases & Gen AI).
  * Building a tokenizer from scratch.
  * Organizing code with components, utils, and data files.
  * Deploying a React + Vite app to production.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the project and run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/token-lab.git
npm install
npm run dev

##📦 Build for Production

npm run build
