# 🧩 Token-Lab

A simple web app that **tokenizes text into numbers** and also **decodes numbers back into text**.  
Built with **React + Vite**, this project is part of my learning journey in JavaScript, vector databases, and web development.

#🧑‍💻 Why I Built This

*This project was created as part of my Cohort assignment with ChaiCode – GenAI with JS.
*It gave me hands-on experience in:
  * Understanding the basics of text tokenization (used in vector databases & Gen AI)
  * Building a tokenizer from scratch
  * Organizing code with components, utils, and data files
  * Deploying a React + Vite app to production
